      In many universities, there is an abundance of unused resources held by students and faculty. These resources, which range from textbooks and notes to technological devices, often remain unused after a semester or a course has ended. At the same time, there are many students who actively need these resources but may not be able to access them due to financial constraints or lack of information about their availability. Despite the existence of platforms provided by major companies such as Meta and Amazon that allow people to buy, sell, or exchange goods, these platforms are rarely utilized by students for resource sharing within
      the university. This discrepancy could be attributed to the absence of physical evidence of exchanges, which leads to a lack of trust in the security and reliability of these transactions. Additionally, these platforms often involve fees or additional costs, making them less appealing to students looking for affordable solutions.

      A dedicated platform that is integrated into the local university setting can serve as a bridge between those who have surplus resources and those in need. The goal of such a platform is to facilitate the exchange of resources within the university community, offering not only a digital solution but also physical exchange points on campus. These physical booths act as verified exchange points, ensuring that transactions are secure and the presence of the resources is tangible. This approach adds a layer of accountability and trust, which is often missing from large-scale online platforms. Moreover, the absence of transaction fees or the implementation of minimal fees greatly reduces costs for students, making resource-sharing a financially viable option. Students can exchange books, gadgets, and course materials without the financial burden typically associated with purchasing new items.
      For instance, at the university of California (UC Berkeley), the ReUSE program focuses on reducing waste by facilitating the reuse of items like textbooks, stationery, and other materials on campus. This initiative is part of the university's broader Cal Zero Waste program, which aims to minimize campus waste through recycling and resource-sharing
